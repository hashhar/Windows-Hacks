# "Take Ownership" Context Menu Command

This is a registry script that adds some keys to your registry to add a context
menu command labelled _"Take Ownership"_ which allows you to change ownership of
a directory or file to the currently logged in user.

There is both an [install.reg](install.reg) and [uninstall.reg](uninstall.reg)
which do what they say.
