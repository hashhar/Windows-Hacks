# Windows Hacks For The Power User (and the lazy)

**_NOTE_: This repository has been restructured completely and most of the things work differently from how you may remember. I would advise starting over instead of trying to monkey-patch your way to success.**

This repository contains registry scripts, batch files and some knowledge to help you make your Windows do awesome stuff (at least by my standards).

I've tried to automate away most of the process using PowerShell so you will need something later and greater than Windows XP.

## Structure of repository

The repository is divided into three subfolders:

- Knowledge Base:
  This is for textual content that tells you more about the OS you use daily and how to make it suit you even more.
- Scheduled Tasks:
  This is for things that have to happen on a recurring basis to keep you happy and your OS pimped out. Good examples are wallpaper switching, battery report generation etc.
- One Off Tasks:
  This is for things that are one-off improvements to Windows and don't need to be repeated.
